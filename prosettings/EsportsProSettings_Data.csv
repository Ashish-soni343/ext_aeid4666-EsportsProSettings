The Adjustment Factors Data Feed main use is to back adjust EOD (end of day) per-share price data so that the price series can be graphed with the effect of several events (bonus, rights, consolidation, etc) factored into the earlier prices.
All per-share series, including prices, earnings per share, dividends per share, assets per share, cash flow per share, etc. need to be adjusted before meaningful conclusions can be drawn about growth rates, trends, etc.<br>
The feed has all necessary fields so that clients can identify the country, security, event  factor.<br>
Further the feed has been designed for clients to database the records or apply directly to price series data. The file also covers all corporate actions spanning multiple currencies for the same event. The main benefit of this feed over competitor feeds is that it can be fully automated allowing the handling of messy cancellations and corporate action changes to happen seamlessly in the background. EDI has recently launched a new version (2) of the Worldwide Adjustment Factor feed<br>
service.
The major three additions are as follows:<br>
• Inclusion of FIGI codes. FIGI codes have been added which will allow clients to crosscheck data sets.<br>
• The fields that were sub-fields in the Detail field of the previous version now have their own fields.For example, DivType was in the Detail field (event description) as DIVPERIOD= This will allow for<br>
easier integration of the data.<br>
• The Reason codes are different, expanded to 3 characters enabling higher level groupings of reasons. For example, all dividend reasons begin with 01, with the 3rd character depending on whether it is cash, script or both. This allows greater granularity when deciding to apply or not.<br>

We are an innovative ‘Spatial Finance’ company unifying geospatial-climate, socio-economic, entity relationship and other data sources for use in operational assessment, risk management, portfolio/index construction and variety of other business decisions. The resulting highly connected and consistent data structure is known as a Knowledge Graph.
The first of its kind ‘AI Ready’ Demographic Knowledge Graph connecting 600 million+ demographic attributes that can be easily accessed and exploited via data science, statistical, and data visualization platforms.

Data Precision, Data Connectivity and Hierarchical Relationships fully established
118,000 Geographic Entities (Country, CBSA, State, County, City, Zip Code, Census Tract)
6,000+ attribute types per geographic entity type
645 Million+ attribute values
Simple ways to connect to existing corporate and third-party data sets

For data to be considered in an AI ready state. The following ‘data’ conditions need to be in place:

Data Connectivity – All the individual data points need to be directly connected or indirectly connected to one another
Data Precision – Data must be high quality. ‘Dirty’ data will invalidate ML/AI results every time
Standardized Taxonomies – A consistent approach to classifying and relating data points. ML/AI does not like inconsistent or multiple data schemas
Hierarchical Relationship Support – Hierarchies play a critical factor in mapping data relationships, data networks, and building decision trees. ML/AI ‘shines’ when
hierarchical relationships are fully supported.
Data Aggregation/Data Drill Down – Knowledge Graphs support simple methods for data aggregation and data drill drown
Point in Time (PIT) – All nodes or entities in a Knowledge Graph can support attribute values over time
Data Visualization Opportunities Increase – Data connectivity greatly expands and enhances data visualization and data reporting
Data Integration – The ability to provide multiple ways to easily connect to other third party and open data sources
Single Data Catalog – Simple way to drive data discovery and data access

Estimate income and evaluate stocks and ETFs based on accurate two year forward dividend forecasts across 25k+ securities globally.
Use our forward dividend prediction data feed to obtain up-to-date information on the dates and payments of thousands of securities across 1000+ indices / 100+ countries.
Our single stock and ETF dividend forecast data elements include:
Predicted ex, record and pay dates<br>

Unique Dividend Forecast Data Methodology<br>
In these times of accelerating change our tech-driven approach gives us a powerful and disruptive edge over the older, more traditional forecasting methodologies<br>
Working from EDI’s global corporate actions database (dating back to 2012) our dividend projections are based on a combination of stated dividend policies and predictable patterns. The estimate data is generated by a dedicated London team working with our proprietary algorithm and enhanced with manual analyst input where required.
This algorithm+analyst approach gives estimates with both huge scale and strong accuracy – our forward-looking data runs two full fiscal years ahead for well over 25,000 securities including equity, ADR and ETF future projections.
Our Woodseer single stock forecast data-set went live in January 2017, and the ETF dividend forecast product launched in July 2019 with detailed forward projections (dates and amounts) for over 1400 ETFs including 700+ US-listed. Working closely with a specialist ETF data provider we combine their compositional ETF data with our own underlying security estimates to produce accurate ‘bottom-up’ forecasts.

By collecting data in real-time we can automatically organise it, filter it, translate it, score it and weight it using extensive language libraries and state-of-the-art techniques in sentiment analysis.
The emergence of social media over the last ten years has been dramatic. In trading and risk management, the importance and use of such data is only just being understood. Buried in this sea of information, CubeWatch is able to continually capture and store this data in a way that can provide insights into market activity, trends and sentiment for the trading community.
The primary method of scoring in CubeWatch is via Sentiment Analysis. Sentiment Analysis is the use of natural language processing to systematically identify, extract, quantify and study subjective information. This proves to be very useful in social media and online content monitoring as it allows us to gain an overview of the wider public opinion behind certain companies or markets. However, this is no mean feat. Machine learning and high quality evolving lexicons are essential for fast, accurate sentiment analysis on such large scales which is why sentiment algorithms remain an active area of academic study today.Features of CubeWatch:

Get all the latest market and sentiment data from Twitter, news organisations and online blogs
Enter custom scoring cirteria and source weighting preferences to further customise your data
